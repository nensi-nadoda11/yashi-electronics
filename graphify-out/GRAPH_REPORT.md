## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Are the 6 inferred relationships involving `successResponse()` (e.g. with `registerCustomerController()` and `loginCustomerController()`) actually correct?**
  _`successResponse()` has 6 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Should `Community 0` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.13 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
- **Should `Community 1` be split into smaller, more focused modules?**
  _Cohesion score 0.14 - nodes in this community are weakly interconnected._
